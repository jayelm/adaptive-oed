## Infants selectively encode the goal object of an actor's reach
### Woodward 1998

- Q: Do infants understand the goals of an actor? How early?
- Intro
    - Infants have (deceptively) rich knowledge: folk psych, ToM
        - (But not enough to ToM pass false belief tasks until later)
        - By necessity: understanding human action has to diverge from theory
          of physics since humans have minds
        - Empirically: tons of evidence
        - Important to ToM is **goal-directedness**: human minds have goals and
          their actions voluntarily attempt to fulfill these goals
            - Gergeley et al - really interesting - animate vs inanimate
              circles
            - see Felix Warneken
    - Test paradigm: visual habituation
        - Infants look longer at events that seem new
        - If present events that vary along some dimension, ^ shows infants
          have encoded the change
    - Goal: test infant's encoding of goal-directed action: reaching toward and
      grasping an object
- Procedure
    - Study 1: 9 month olds
        - Actor habitually reaches towards a toy, grasping it. Then toys are
          swapped. One event: actor reaches to new location. Other event: actor
          reaches to different toy.
        - Control for hand stimulus - use an inanimate rod condition as well
        - Control/counterbalance for location (left or right of target)
        - One infant sees BOTH events
        - Two observers, 82-88% agreement, disagreements random not biased
    - Study 2: 5 month olds
    - Study 3: Control for differences in occlusion (visual scene unique)
        causing effect
- Results
    - Study 1: 9 month olds
        - A priori planned comparisons: babies looked longer at new goal/old path
          versus old goal/new path (DOUBLE DISSOCIATION) for hands
        - No effect for rods
        - Run t-test and nonparametric (wilcoxon, mann-whitney U test), same
          conclusions p < 0.05
        - Control for getting bored of looking at same stimulus - compare test
            performance to LAST THREE trial performance
        - Why don't babies look at rod? Rod less interesting? Hands do cool
          stuff. Thus compare *proportions* of trial/test for rods and hands
          (scale-invariant)
    - Study 2: 5 month olds
        - Results similar but LESS reliable in rod condition, babies look more at old
            goal/new path, wonder why?
        - Yougner infants look longer on displays on average
        - ALTHOUGH results are different (5/11 split) versus (7/9) split,
            interaction between age and trial is NOT significant!! (Odd, too
            small sample size? It's like only 2 people switch from 5mo to 9mo)
        - 

## Meeting + how to read a scientific paper: Led by Kyle MacDonald

### Exercise 1 four sentences:

1. What is the developmental trajectory of infants' understanding of peoples'
   goal-directed actions?
2. Infants as young as 5 months old show early evidence of understanding
   goal-directed actions in a visual habituation task where they selectively encoding the goal of an actor in reaching for and grasping objects.
3. Controlling for various factors, 5 month old and 9 month old infants look
   statistically significantly longer at human arms in a grasping task when they deviate from previously habituated goals.
4. This visual habituation task is remarkably early evidence for the formation
   of more advanced, sophisticated goal-directed actions present later in
   childhood development.

### Exercise 2 select four sentences

1. Do young infants reason in specific and appropriate ways about the actions
   of other people?
2. Taken together, these findings indicate that young infants distinguish in
    their reasoning about human action and object motion, and that by 6 months
    infants encode the actions of other people in ways that are consistent with
    more mature understandings of goal-directed action 
3.
4. Last two sentences?


### Exercise 3 new sentences
1. How early do infants begin to understand the goals of other peoples'
   actions?
2. Infants as young as 5 months old understand the goals of peoples' actions
   differently than inanimate object motion.
3. Controlling for several confounding factors, 5mo/9mo infants look longer at
   human arms in a grasping task when the arms deviate from previously
   habituated goals, a difference that is not observed when observing inanimate
   hand-like objects undergoing the same actions.
4. This study provides remarkably early evidence that infants begin to lay the
   foundation for advanced, sophisticated ToM early in childhood development.

### Figures

Infants didn't differ in how long it takes them to habituate
